# Django Ad Campaign Manager

## Overview

This is a research report that provides comprehensive documentation for the Django Ad Campaign Manager project. The project is designed to manage advertising campaigns and is divided into two major components: the backend, which utilizes Django Rest Framework (DRF) and drf-yasg for API documentation, and the frontend, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two distinct folders:

1. **Backend**
   - This folder contains all the server-side logic of the application.
   - It utilizes Django as the web framework and Django Rest Framework for creating RESTful APIs.
   - API documentation is generated using drf-yasg.
   - To get started with the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory and refer to its own README for setup instructions.

2. **Frontend**
   - The frontend of the application is implemented using Next.js, a React framework for server-rendered applications.
   - Tailwind CSS is used for styling to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.
   - For details on setting up and running the frontend, please go to the `frontend` directory and consult the accompanying README.
